## Introduction

ESLint and Prettier are powerful tools used to analyze and format code in JavaScript projects. ESLint helps in identifying and fixing code errors and enforcing consistent coding standards, while Prettier automatically formats the code to maintain a consistent style.

This repository serves as a starting point for your React projects and showcases how to configure ESLint and Prettier to work together seamlessly.

## Features

- Basic React app setup
- ESLint configuration for consistent coding styles
- Prettier configuration for automatic code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before every commit

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-app.git

2. Change directory to the project folder:

cd your-react-app

3. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can run it locally using the following command:

npm start

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Linting and Formatting

The project is already configured with ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistent formatting. To run the linter and formatter, use the following command:

npm run lint

This command will check your code for any errors or violations of the configured rules. ESLint will attempt to automatically fix some of the issues. If any issues remain, you will need to manually fix them before committing your changes.

Before committing, ESLint and Prettier will be run automatically through a pre-commit hook to ensure that the code adheres to the defined standards.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing, make sure to follow the coding standards defined in the ESLint configuration to maintain code consistency.
